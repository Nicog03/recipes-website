          Feijoada, Brazil's undisputed national dish is a hearty bean and meat
          stew served with rice and orange wedges. Originally, Feijoada was made
          by using every part of the pig, including the feet, tail and ears
          cooking alongside carne seca, a dry, cured beef found in Brazil, with
          black beans. Finding the specialty meats for Feijoada can be tricky in
          different parts of the United States. The important thing is to use a
          variety of meats; smoked, salted and fresh pork and beef. Here, we use
          more widely available meats to the same, succulent results. This
          recipe makes enough for a whole family – and then some!

              Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy casserole. Add the garlic
              and onion and cook over moderately low heat, stirring
              occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 7 minutes. Stir
              in the drained black beans. Add the water to the casserole and
              bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Reduce the heat to low
              and simmer the beans for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Add all of
              the meats and the dried chile and cook until the beans are tender,
              about 1 hour longer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the meats from the casserole and thickly slice them;
              discard any bones. Pick out and discard the chile. Season the
              beans with salt. Ladle the beans into shallow bowls and serve with
              the sliced meats. Pass the Toasted Manioc Flour at the table for
              sprinkling over the feijoada.
