        <p>Feijoada, Brazil's undisputed national dish is a hearty bean and meat stew served with rice and orange wedges. Originally, Feijoada was made by using every part of the pig, including the feet, tail and ears cooking alongside carne seca, a dry, cured beef found in Brazil, with black beans. Finding the specialty meats for Feijoada can be tricky in different parts of the United States. The important thing is to use a variety of meats; smoked, salted and fresh pork and beef. Here, we use more widely available meats to the same, succulent results. This recipe makes enough for a whole family â€“ and then some!</p>
