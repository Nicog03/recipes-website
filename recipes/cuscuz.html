        <p>Couscous is a North African dish made from tiny steamed balls of semolina flour. Though we think of it and cook it as a grain, couscous is actually a type of pasta. It’s one of the easiest, fastest, most versatile side dishes you can make. And it’s especially wonderful with stews or saucy main dishes. Depending on which brand you buy, you’ll find that there’s some variation on the suggested proportions of liquid to couscous.</p>
