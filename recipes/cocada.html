          Cocada is a popular street food sold everywhere in Brazil. It's a
          sweet made with grated fresh coconut. There are many variations, this
          one with a hint of vanilla is one of them. Use the tin of condensed
          milk for measuring the sugar, as well.

            <li>
              Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a
              large saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly,
              until the mixture thickens and becomes a little darker. If you
              find that the cocada is cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low
              and continue stirring.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the mixture has thickened enough and feels heavy on the
              spoon, remove from heat and place spoonfuls on a piece of
              parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let cool for about 30 minutes (cocada will harden a bit) and
              transfer to a sealed container.
            </li>
