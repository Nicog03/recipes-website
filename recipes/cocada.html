        <p>Cocada is a popular street food sold everywhere in Brazil. It's a sweet made with grated fresh coconut. There are many variations, this one with a hint of vanilla is one of them. Use the tin of condensed milk for measuring the sugar, as well.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/2 can sugar (use sweetened condensed milk can as measure)</li>
            <li>3 cups grated fresh coconut</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to make it</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes a little darker. If you find that the cocada is cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low and continue stirring.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture has thickened enough and feels heavy on the spoon, remove from heat and place spoonfuls on a piece of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Let cool for about 30 minutes (cocada will harden a bit) and transfer to a sealed container.</li>
        </ol>
