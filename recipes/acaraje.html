        <p>Acarajé are a specialty of the state of Bahia in Brazil, and a popular street food and beach snack. Black-eyed peas, seasoned with ground dried shrimp and onions, are shaped into fritters and deep fried in palm (dende) oil, then split and filled with various fillings, such as vatapa, or in this case a spicy shrimp and onion mixture. Though dried shrimp are a traditional ingredient in acaraje, they tend to impart a very strong flavor. In this milder version, the cooked fritter is split and then filled with fresh shrimp and caramelized onions.</p>

        <p>The traditional method for preparing these fritters is quite labor-intensive - it involves soaking dried black-eyed peas and then removing the skins. This recipe is a shortcut version using canned black-eyed peas, which speeds up the process greatly but is not completely authentic. Since you are already deviating from tradition with this recipe, try pairing acaraje with non-traditional fillings, such as ham salad, pimento cheese, olive tapenade, etc.</p>
