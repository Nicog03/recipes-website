          Acarajé are a specialty of the state of Bahia in Brazil, and a popular
          street food and beach snack. Black-eyed peas, seasoned with ground
          dried shrimp and onions, are shaped into fritters and deep fried in
          palm (dende) oil, then split and filled with various fillings, such as
          vatapa, or in this case a spicy shrimp and onion mixture. Though dried
          shrimp are a traditional ingredient in acaraje, they tend to impart a
          very strong flavor. In this milder version, the cooked fritter is
          split and then filled with fresh shrimp and caramelized onions.

          The traditional method for preparing these fritters is quite
          labor-intensive - it involves soaking dried black-eyed peas and then
          removing the skins. This recipe is a shortcut version using canned
          black-eyed peas, which speeds up the process greatly but is not
          completely authentic. Since you are already deviating from tradition
          with this recipe, try pairing acaraje with non-traditional fillings,
          such as ham salad, pimento cheese, olive tapenade, etc.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Make filling: Slice the onion very thinly. Place the sliced onions
              in a skillet with the olive oil or palm oil, sprinkle with salt
              and chile powder, and cook on low heat until they are soft and
              golden brown (about 15 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the shrimp and sauté until shrimp are pink. Remove from heat
              and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the fritters: Thoroughly drain the black-eyed peas and place
              them in the food processor. Roughly chop the onion and garlic, and
              add it to the peas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the seeds and white parts from the inside of the chile
              pepper and add to the processor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Process mixture just until very well-blended, adding a tablespoon
              or two of water or broth if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add flour by the tablespoon, until the mixture is stiff enough to
              hold a shape. Divide into 15 pieces, and shape into balls or ovals
              with the palms of your hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat 2 inches palm oil and/or vegetable oil in a pot over
              medium-high heat. Fry several fritters at a time until browned on
              all sides. Drain fritters on a plate lined with paper towels.
              Fritters can be kept warm in a 200-degree oven.
            </li>
            <li>
              Split fritters in half and fill with a spoonful of the onion and
              shrimp mixture. Serve warm.
