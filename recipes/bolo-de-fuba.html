          In Brazil, sweet cornmeal cake (called Bolo de Fubá) is a staple for
          breakfast or for an afternoon snack with coffee. In some homes, the
          cakes are made with cheese or coconut for a rich, dense consistency
          (commonly called Bolo de Fubá Cremoso). In this classic version, fine
          ground cornmeal encourages a delicate texture. As the cake cooks in
          the oven, it fills the kitchen with a sweet, warm aroma. Delicious
          slightly warm, or at room temperature, this light Brazilian Cornmeal
          Cake is not to be missed.
