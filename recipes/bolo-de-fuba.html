        <p>In Brazil, sweet cornmeal cake (called Bolo de Fub치) is a staple for breakfast or for an afternoon snack with coffee. In some homes, the cakes are made with cheese or coconut for a rich, dense consistency (commonly called Bolo de Fub치 Cremoso). In this classic version, fine ground cornmeal encourages a delicate texture. As the cake cooks in the oven, it fills the kitchen with a sweet, warm aroma. Delicious slightly warm, or at room temperature, this light Brazilian Cornmeal Cake is not to be missed.
